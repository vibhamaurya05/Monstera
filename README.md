I created this Gaming Landing Page project using HTML and CSS, which gave me more experience in understanding hoe HTML and CSS work in designing any web page.

## What I learned from this project
I learned how to position the main image in the project and how to give equal space to multiple elements within a div.
### I took 6 hours to complete it.
